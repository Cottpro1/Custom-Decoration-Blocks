# CDB

This is CDB (Custom Decoration Blocks), a project where we are trying to shape the future of datapack creation. Every day we are getting a step closer to custom decoration blocks, and if we can design a system that can create a CDB that is well optimized, and reliable, then just think of the possabilities that will open up. Datapacks will be one step closer to acting like mods.
